<h1 align="center">Betterprompt Rocket 🚀</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>The World’s Simplest (and Smallest) LLM-Native Web Framework</strong></p>

Better Prompt Rocket is an **AI-optimized, accessibility-first web template** designed for the generative era. While traditional frameworks are built for human eyes, Rocket is built for **Machine Understanding**. By leveraging hyper-semantic HTML and a zero-dependency architecture, Rocket allows LLMs to generate, modify, and scale digital properties with perfect accuracy and minimal token overhead.

> **Why Rocket?** Because the best way to build a website in 2026 isn't by writing code; it's by providing context to an AI that speaks "Betterprompt Rocket."

---

## AI-Optimized Advantages
* **Token Efficiency:** Minimalist structure ensures your entire site architecture fits within standard LLM context windows.
* **Semantic Predictability:** Uses strict ARIA and HTML5 standards, reducing AI "hallucinations" during component generation.
* **Prompt-Ready Templates:** Includes built-in system prompts to help your AI agent understand how to extend the site.
* **Client-Side Intelligence:** Platform-agnostic JS that allows AI-generated content to adapt to user behavior in real-time.

## Project Objective
The objective of Better Prompt's Rocket project is to bridge the gap between **Generative AI** and **Web Performance**. We provide a 'Living Document' standard that allows AI agents to fetch resources, render layouts, and apply personalization without the friction of complex backend dependencies.
